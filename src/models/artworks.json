As they walk along, Jean, his mother Camille, and father Claude stop for a moment to catch their breath. At that time, the family's father moves away from his wife and son to a higher place and watches and looks at them. The scene in front of the father is very interesting to him. There are more than just two normal people in front of him... A beautiful green parasol, his only wife, and his own son. The sky is deep blue, and the trees are lush green. Claude said that all of these things together were worth watching for hours. That's why he paints his wife and son on that hill: so he can look at this scene for all time...\n","id":1706176454465},{"id":1706177100922,"title":"Las Meninas","creationDate":"1656","medium":"qweq","dimensions":"weq","artistId":"1706176932986","imageURL":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/31/Las_Meninas%2C_by_Diego_Velázquez%2C_from_Prado_in_Google_Earth.jpg/250px-Las_Meninas%2C_by_Diego_Velázquez%2C_from_Prado_in_Google_Earth.jpg","description":"The painting \"Las Meninas\" by Diego Velázquez in 1656 is his most famous work. The piece of art shows a scene in King Philip IV of Spain's royal court and has a complicated and unique design. The Infanta Margarita is in the middle, with her maids-of-honor, a court dwarf, a dog, and Velázquez himself surrounding her. People love the picture because of the way the light and shadow play off of each other, the small details, and how the artist is included in the scene, making the interaction between the viewer, the subjects, and the artist himself very interesting. \"Las Meninas\" is thought to be the best example of Baroque art and shows how skilled and creative Velázquez was."}]
